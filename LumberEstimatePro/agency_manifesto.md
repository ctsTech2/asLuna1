# LumberEstimatePro Manifesto

## Mission
Our mission is to streamline and automate the process of creating accurate and code-compliant estimates for construction projects at a lumberyard. By leveraging AI and modern UI frameworks, we aim to provide a seamless experience for users, ensuring their projects meet all necessary building codes and are cost-effective.

## Goals
1. **User Interaction**: Provide an intuitive and interactive user interface to gather all necessary project details.
2. **Code Compliance**: Ensure all projects comply with Wisconsin building codes by referencing an external Pinecone database.
3. **Accurate Estimates**: Generate accurate material estimates based on current prices at the lumberyard.
4. **Efficiency**: Minimize the time and effort required to create these estimates.

## Working Environment
- **User Interface**: Built using MUI (Material-UI) for a modern and responsive design.
- **Database**: Pinecone database for referencing Wisconsin building codes.
- **Coordination**: Autonomous agents working collaboratively to achieve the common goal of generating accurate and compliant estimates.
